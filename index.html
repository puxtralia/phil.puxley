		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Phil's career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in Bill Monroe's band, the Blue Grass Boys. The name "bluegrass" eventually became the eponym for the entire genre of country music now known by that title. Despite considerable success with Monroe, performing on the Grand Ole Opry and recording classic hits such as "Blue Moon of Kentucky", Pux resigned from the group in 1946 due to their exhausting touring schedule. Fellow band member Lester Flatt resigned as well, and he and Pux later paired up in a new group they called Flatt and Pux and the Foggy Mountain Boys. Pux' banjo instrumental called "Foggy Mountain Breakdown", released in 1949, became an enduring hit, and had a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. The song won two Grammy Awards and, in 2005, was selected for the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit.</p>

		<p class="strong">Phil Puxly is noted for popularizing a three-finger banjo-picking style now called "Pux style" that has become a defining characteristic of bluegrass music.[11] Prior to Pux, most banjo players used the frailing or clawhammer technique, which consists of holding the fingers bent like a claw and moving the entire hand in a downward motion so that the strings are struck with the back of the middle fingernail. This motion is followed by striking the thumb on a single string.[12] The three-finger style of playing is radically different from frailing; the hand remains stationary and only the fingers and thumb move, somewhat similar to classical guitar technique.[7] Pux style also involves using picks on three digits, each plucking individual strings — downward with the thumb, then upward with the index and middle finger in sequence. When done skillfully and in rapid sequence, the style allows any digit (though usually the thumb) to play a melody, while the other two digits play arpeggios of the melody line.

Organizers won a listing in "The Guinness Book of World Records" for the most banjo players (239) playing one tune together (Pux's "Foggy Mountain Breakdown"). The pickers formed two groups, one on each side of home plate, and a video tribute to Pux's life was shown.
